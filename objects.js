// create an object fruits with at least 5 fruits that have the name of the fruit as the key and the value being the color of the fruit
// print out each value in that object manually

//then print out each value using a for loop

//reassign one of the keys in the object to have a different value

// write a function that takes in an object and key and returns that value at that key in the object
